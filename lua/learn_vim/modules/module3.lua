Welcome to Module 3, Lesson 3.1!

Moving character by character with `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` is fundamental, but Vim offers much faster ways to navigate. Moving by **words** is one of the most common.

In Normal mode:
* `w` - Move cursor to the **start** of the **next** word.
* `b` - Move cursor to the **start** of the **previous** word.
* `e` - Move cursor to the **end** of the **current** or next word.

Try using these commands to move the cursor around the text in the exercise pane. Remember that punctuation is often treated as a separate word in Vim.

Use `:LearnVim exc` to check when you think you've completed the task!

Welcome to Lesson 3.2!

Moving word by word is faster than character by character, but sometimes you need to jump much further â€“ like to the very beginning or end of a file.

In Normal mode:
* **`gg`**: Jump to the **first** line of the file.
* **`G`**: Jump to the **last** line of the file.

These are extremely useful for quickly navigating large files.

Let's practice jumping around this exercise buffer. Use `:LearnVim exc` to check after each jump.

Welcome to Lesson 3.3!

Beyond the very start and end, you can jump to specific lines and move efficiently within a single line.

In Normal mode:
* **`{number}G`**: Jump to the line number specified by `{number}`. For example, `5G` jumps to line 5.
* **`0`** (zero): Move cursor to the **first character** of the current line (including leading whitespace).
* **`^`**: Move cursor to the **first non-blank character** of the current line.
* **`$`**: Move cursor to the **end** of the current line.

Let's practice these precise line movements. Use `:LearnVim exc` after each step.

Welcome to Lesson 3.4!

Vim commands can often be prefixed with a **number** to repeat the action that many times. This is incredibly powerful for faster navigation and editing.

For example:
* `3j` - Move down 3 lines.
* `5k` - Move up 5 lines.
* `10w` - Move forward 10 words.
* `2b` - Move backward 2 words.

This works with many movement commands!

Let's practice using counts with vertical and horizontal movements. Use `:LearnVim exc` after each step.
