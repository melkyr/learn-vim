" --- Exercise 10.5.3 (Swift) ---
" Instruction: In this Swift snippet, record a macro into register `k` that changes the word 'var' to 'let' and moves to the next line. Keystrokes: `qk` `cw` `let<Esc>` `j` `0` `q`. Then play the macro 2 times using `2@k`. Type `:LearnVim exc` to check.
" Use `:LearnVim exc` to check, `:LearnVim exr` to reset.
