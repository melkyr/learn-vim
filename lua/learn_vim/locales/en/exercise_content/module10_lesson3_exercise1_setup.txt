" --- Exercise 10.3.1 (Python) ---
" Instruction: In this Python snippet, record a macro into register `c` that deletes the word 'print' and moves to the next line. Keystrokes: `qc` `dw` `j` `q`. Then play the macro 3 times using `3@c` to delete 'print' on the next three lines. Type `:LearnVim exc` to check.
" Use `:LearnVim exc` to check, `:LearnVim exr` to reset.
