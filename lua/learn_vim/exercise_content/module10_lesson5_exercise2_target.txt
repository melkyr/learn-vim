" --- Exercise 10.5.2 (Rust) ---
" Instruction: In this Rust snippet, record a macro into register `j` that deletes the word 'let' and moves to the next line. Keystrokes: `qj` `dw` `j` `0` `q`. Then play the macro 2 times using `2@j`. Type `:LearnVim exc` to check.
" Use `:LearnVim exc` to check, `:LearnVim exr` to reset.
" ---------------------------------------------
fn main() {
     x = 10;
     y = 20;
    let z = x + y;
    println!("Sum: {}", z);
}
