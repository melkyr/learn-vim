All that is silver does not glitter, Not all those who roam are lost; The ancient that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the sun. From the ashes a spark shall be woken, A glow from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was mended, The crownless again shall be queen.
