" --- Exercise 10.6.1 (Ruby) ---
" Instruction: In this Ruby snippet, record a macro into register `l` that deletes the word 'puts' and moves to the next line. Keystrokes: `ql` `dw` `j` `0` `q`. Then play the macro 2 times using `2@l`. Type `:LearnVim exc` to check.
" Use `:LearnVim exc` to check, `:LearnVim exr` to reset.
" ---------------------------------------------
"First message"
"Second message"
puts "Third message"
# This line is different
